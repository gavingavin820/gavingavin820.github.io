<center><h1>GAVIN AURELUS'S JOURNAL</h1></center>
<div></div>
<p> Journal entry #1: Today I learned how to add different fonts to my journal. We also learned how to upload our websites onto the internet. I am excited to start on some of my projects and mess around with formatting my website!  </p>

<p> Journal entry #2: Over the weekend, we finished up our person cards and I watched videos about how the internet works. I also further aestheticized my website. I added divs and buttons and a background gif to the home page of my website. My next step is to make my journal page more interesting as well!   </p>

<p>
Journal entry #3: I was inspired by an animation that I saw posted on the class website and so I decided to make a pinwheel by animating a large div. I think that I could refine the code and make it work for longer and add some more colors.

</p>
<p>
Journal entry #4: In class, we were working on event listeners and were introduced to javascript. I learned about the code that would be required to track the position of the mouse on screen. I was inspired by this and decided to make a project that told people where their cursor is (in case they didn't know). I just used the javascript code and added the cursor div and some text.

</p>
<p>
Journal entry #5: In class we were asked to modify the square quilt. The square quilt adds a div after a set few milliseconds. I decided to style my div with an image of  arabbit because this project reminded me of the expression "multiply like rabbits". So finally, I made the project add a new rabbit on the page after every second.

</p>
<p>
Journal entry #6: For my next project, which I called "fortune teller", I used an array in javascript. The array allowed me to add the fortunes in the pfortune teller and it also randomized them. So every time you click on the screen, a fortune from a prewritten list of fortunes appears randomly. I then added the text and the crystal ball image. Currently, this might be my favorite project I've made so far.

</p>
<p>
Journal entry #7: In class, we were told to make a project with audio that also used an "if then" statement. The "if then" statement was useful in my code because it allowed me to create a click counter that used binary to play and pause the audio.
