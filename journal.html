<p> Journal entry #1: Today I learned how to add different fonts to my journal. We also learned how to upload our websites onto the internet. I am excited to start on some of my projects and mess around with formatting my website!  </p>

<p> Journal entry #2: Over the weekend, we finished up our person cards and I watched videos about how the internet works. I also further aestheticized my website. I added divs and buttons and a background gif to the home page of my website. My next step is to make my journal page more interesting as well!   </p>
